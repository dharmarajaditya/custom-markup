I wish to hear from some expert over this issue.

I want to create custom-mark-up-language which uses "utf-8" character set and "Sanskrit (संस्कृत)" locale keywords/tagNames.

In my specifications "<" and ">" are to be replaced by "ॐ" and "अथ ॐ " respectively and the Document Type to be replaced by "भाषा"

Someone please guide me how should I do so.

I need help for the following:

>> Defining Objects for my-custom-markup-language

>> Defining Tag Names for my-custom-markup-language

>> Defining namespace for my-custom-markup-language

and all related areas for creating a mark-up-language.

I need to know only about the methods to specify, define and create standards for a custom-mark-up-language.
